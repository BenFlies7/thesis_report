\section{Introduction}

  Cancer represents a huge burden for health care systems worldwide and one of
  the leading death causes. In 2012, there were an estimated 14.1 million new
  cancer cases with estimated  8.2 million cancer deaths
  {\cite{cancer_stats_worldwide:2012}}. Lung cancer is the most common cancer,
  both in terms of new cases (1.8 million) and deaths (1.6 million). Breast
  cancer is the second most common cancer (1.7 million cases) but only ranks 5th
  as cause of death (522,000 deaths). Colorectal cancer (1.4 million cases;
  694,000 deaths), prostate cancer (1.1 million cases; 307,000 deaths), stomach
  cancer (951,000 cases; 723,000 deaths) and liver cancer (782,000 cases;
  723,000 deaths) are following.

  Scientific discoveries in the last decade have had an enormous impact on our
  understanding of the underlying causes of cancer. The development of omics
  techniques, in combination with enhanced computational power, has lead to an
  explosion of biological data. It has become clear that cancer is an incredibly
  complex malignancy. The research community is trying to interprete this vast
  amount of data with the goal to get a deeper understanding of cancer and to
  cure it eventually. In recent years, several drugs have been approved that
  target proteins needed for cancer development, proliferation or metastasis.
  Molecular testing is employed to check whether these targeted drugs would be
  of benefit. In that regard, Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) is an interesting
  method to gain deep insights into the genetic information of a tumor and to
  guide personalized therapy.

  \subsection{Targeting Cancer}

    It is widely accepted that cancer is a disease caused by genomic instability.
    The genetic diversity caused by this instability, in combination with several
    environmental factors, such as inflammation, enables the hallmarks of cancer
    (Hallmarks of Cancer: The Next Generation). These include replicative
    immortality, cell death resistance, ongoing proliferative signaling,
    invasion and metastasis, growth suppressor evasion, inducement of
    angiogenesis, energy metabolism reprogramming and immune destruction evasion.

    Virtually all cancers tend to accumulate mutations during their progression.
    Genomic instability is one of the cardinal features of cancer.
    Cancer development is considered to be a state of imbalance between the
    occurrence of mutations and cell-cycle control mechanisms. In many cancers,
    several pathways contribute to the abnormal cell growth: chromosomal
    instability (CIN), microsatellite instability (MSI) and the CpG island
    methylator phenotype (CIMP).

    Large-scale studies have demonstrated that cancers are highly heterogeneous.
    This heterogeneity has been observed both at the inter- and intra-level. Two
    tumors of similar phenotype often comprise a different subset of mutations
    that may even have a low overlap. Several clonal subpopulations within the
    same tumor contribute to the intra-tumor heterogeneity. This is a
    considerable problem in the clinics, as some subpopulations of a cancer may
    become resistant to the  treatment and may be the source of relapses.

    Many alterations found in cancer cells are passenger mutations, e.g. do not
    contribute to the selective fitness of the cell. Driver mutations, often
    happening on oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes, promote the cell's
    fitness. This view recognizes Darwinian evolution principles. The
    heterogeneous  population of cancer cells harbors cells with different
    random somatic and non-deleterious mutations and exhibits different
    perturbations. Cells with the best fitness, e.g. with the highest
    proliferative potential  and the lowest death rate, are then selected
    through natural selection principles. These cells will outlast less fit
    cells. This results in  sequential waves of clonal expansion, leading to
    different subclones within the same tumor that differ in their
    proliferative, migrative and invasive potential.

    Genomic instability in cancerous cells becomes a critical mechanism if it
    affects oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. Tumor suppressor genes protect
    a cell from entering the path to cancer. Tumor suppressor genes comprise
    genes encoding for cell adhesion proteins,  DNA repair proteins, proteins
    acting in apoptosis pathways, or or cell cycle proteins. The action of these
    proteins inhibits metastasis, cell survival or proliferation. Tumor
    suppressors mostly follow the two-hit hypothesis, which was first proposed
    by Knudson  for the retinoblastoma protein (pRb): to inactivate the
    tumor-protecting role of these genes and their proteins, two genetic events,
    often LOH in  combination with silencing point mutations, are necessary to
    inactivate both alleles of the protein. Another possibility of tumor
    suppressor inactivation is methylation of the gene promoter. Compared to
    dominant oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes are often considered to be
    recessive. Alternatively, tumor progression can be influenced by functional
    haploinsufficiency. According to this conception, a disease state can emerge
    if a cell / organism has only one functional  copy of a given gene and if it
    cannot  produce enough of a gene product to establish a wild-type condition.
    Oncogenes comprise several GTPases, transcription factors, receptor tyrosine
    kinases and growth factors. Overexpressed or overactive versions of these
    proteins often lead to increased mitogenic signals, leading to increased
    cell growth or proliferation. Mutations in proto--oncogenes can lead to a
    loss of regulation or overactive proteins. Gene duplications or other
    chromosomal alterations lead to increased protein synthesis. Other
    mechanisms of importance include post-transcriptional mechanisms as
    misregulation of protein expression or increase of mRNA / protein stability.

    The EGFR signaling pathway is an oncogenic pathway frequently altered in
    many cancers. EGFR signaling promotes cell survival and proliferation.

    Pathway erklÃ¤ren.

    Many cancers have been shown to overexpress EGFR or to harbor activating
    mutations in EGFR or downstream proteins, both leading to increased
    mitogenic signals. Targeting the EGFR signaling pathway is an attractive
    target blabla and has been of benefit in solid tumors, e.g. melanoma, CRC
    and NSCLC. Melanoma, colorectal cancers and non-small cell lung cancer
    (NSCLC) are often dependent on EGFR signaling. Shutting down -> apoptosis.
