\section{Introduction}

  Cancer represents a huge burden for health care systems worldwide and is one
  of the leading death causes. Scientific discoveries in the last decade have
  had an enormous impact on our understanding of the underlying causes of
  cancer. The development of omics techniques, in combination with advanced
  computational power, has lead to an explosion of biological data. It has
  become clear that cancer is an incredibly complex malignancy, which is
  affected by genetic, environmental and behavioural factors. The research
  community is trying to interprete this vast amount of data with the goal to
  get a deeper understanding of cancer and to cure it eventually. In recent
  years, several drugs have been approved, which target proteins needed for
  cancer development, proliferation or metastasis. Molecular testing is employed
  to check whether these targeted drugs would be of benefit. In that regard,
  Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) is an interesting method to gain deep
  insights into the genetic information of a tumor and to guide personalized
  therapy.

  \subsection{The cancer genome}

    DNA undergoes continuous damage. In normal cells, this damage is repaired
    without without errors. In cancer cells, the equilibrium between DNA damage
    and repair systems is dysbalanced {\cite{dna_repair_epidemioloy}}. Genetic
    and epigenetic alterations, in combination with several environmental
    factors, such as inflammation, enable the hallmarks of cancer
    {\cite{cancer_hallmarks}}. These include replicative immortality, cell death
    resistance, ongoing proliferative signaling, invasion and metastasis, growth
    suppressor evasion, inducement of angiogenesis, energy metabolism
    reprogramming and immune destruction evasion.

    It is widely accepted that tumors accumulate somatic mutations during their
    progression in malignancy {\cite{accumulation_rates}}
    {\cite{mutations_counting}}. DNA can be damaged by endogenous and
    environmental agents {\cite{multiple_mutations}}. Carcinogenic substances
    produced by industry {\cite{occupational_exposure}} {\cite{rubber_industry}}
    or present in tobacco smoke {\cite{smoking_cancer}} are known to increase
    cancer risk. Cellular metabolic processes also produce DNA-damaging products
    that induce cancer, such as reactive oxygen species {\cite{ros_cancer}}
    {\cite{ros_cancer_other}}. Several cellular DNA repair systems have emerged.
    DNA lesions can escape these repair mechanisms if the damage happens in an
    inaccessible region of the DNA or if the DNA repair system is defective
    {\cite{dna_repair}}.

    Also, the process of DNA replication has an intrinsic error rate. It has
    been estimated that DNA polymerase has error rates ranging from
    10\textsuperscript{-4} to 10\textsuperscript{-6}. This is followed by
    mismatch repair, which corrects 90-99\% of the replication errors,
    decreasing the overall error rate to 10\textsuperscript{-6} to
    10\textsuperscript{-8} {\cite{multiple_mutations}}. Several DNA polymerases
    exist and differ in their error rates. There is evidence that they can be
    used interchangeably. DNA polymerase $\beta$ has a much worse error rate
    than DNA polymerase $\delta$ or $\epsilon$. There is evidence that DNA
    $\beta$ is increased in some tumors {\cite{dna_pol}}, resulting in increased
    mutagenesis.

    Processes affecting chromosomal and microsatellite integrity instability
    contribute to genomic instability in cancer cells. \textbf{Chromosomal
    instability (CIN)} is a common observation in solid tumors, especially
    colorectal cancer {\cite{cin_crc}}. Chromosome missegregation plays a
    crucial role in cancer adaptation {\cite{chromosome_missegregation}}.
    Defects in proteins needed for chromosome segregation lead to chromosome
    missegregation. This leads to telomere dysfunction, faulty sister chromatid
    cohesion, loss of heterozygosity (LOH), hypo-- or hyperactive spindle
    assembly checkpoint or defective centrosome duplication and aneuploidy.
    {\cite{cin_crc}}. About 70\% of solid tumors are aneuploid
    {\cite{aneuploidy}}. Another chromosomal instability process has been
    described recently: chromothripsis happens when chromosomes are fragmented
    {\cite{chromothripsis_1}} {\cite{chromothripsis_2}}
    {\cite{chromothripsis_2}}. The cell tries to repair the chromosomes, but
    this process is far from being perfect, leading to massive chromosomal
    rearrangements. The question whether CIN is a cause or consequence of tumor
    development remains unanswered.

    \textbf{Microsatellite instability (MSI)} is caused by inactivation or loss
    of DNA mismatch repair {\cite{msi}}. Microsatellites are short DNA segments
    with tandem repeats. Microsatellite elongation or shortening is a
    consequence of defective or inactive DNA mismatch repair (MMR), which
    corrects base replication errors {\cite{cin_crc}}. Germline mutations in MMR
    genes cause the Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolypsos colorectal cancer)
    {\cite{lynch}}. Patients have an 80\% lifetime risk to develop colon cancer.
    DNA polymerase has a higher error rate in repetitive regions. When MMR genes
    are inactivated or defective, the replication mistakes in microsatellites
    cannot be corrected: MSI is the consequence. In some cancers, MSI can occur
    despite functional MMR through frameshift mutations at microsatellites. MSI
    is often associated with cancers harboring mutations in TGF$\beta$RII, EGFR,
    PTEN, and BAX, which contain such simple repeats {\cite{micro}}.

    \textbf{Epigenetic changes}

    \subsubsection{Molecular Profiling of Solid Tumors}

    The previously discussed cancer characteristics, heterogeneity and
    accumulation of mutations, becomes evident in the molecular profiling
    of solid tumors.

    \textbf{Lung cancer} is the most common cancer worldwide, both in terms of
    new cases (1.8 million) and deaths (1.6 million). Smoking is a widely
    accepted risk factor, as chemical carcinogens in tobacco smoke induce
    several genetic mutations. Lung cancer can be divided
    into two histological subtypes: small-cell lung cancer (SCLL) and non-small
    cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Over the last decade, it has become clear that
    these subtypes can be classified into  additional classes by the mutational
    status of recurrent driver mutations.

    A combination of oncogenic triggers cause cells of the normal bronchial
    epithelium to proliferate, giving rise to meta--, hyper-- and dysplastic
    epithelial lesions. Genomic events in early stages of lung cancer giving
    rise to atypical adenomatous hperplasia include LOH of 3p,
    p16\textsuperscript{INK4a} or RB inactivation, as well as
    mutations in KRAS or in $\beta$--catenin. TP53
    inactivation and LOH at 13q are believed to favor progression into
    the primary adenocarcinoma stage. After that stage, major chromosomic
    instability is often detected, giving rise to metastatic adenocarcinoma.
    These chromosomic events include LOH of 2q, 9p, 18q,
    and 22q. Additionally, the oncogene c-myc can be amplified.

    Frequent  mutations in NSCLC, which are of potential interest in a targeted
    anti-tumor chemotherapy, affect EGFR (10--35\%), KRAS (15--25\%), PTEN
    (4--8\%), HER2 (2--4\%), DDR2 (4\%), PIK3CA (1--3\%), BRAF (1--3\%), AKT1
    (1\%), MEK (1\%) and NRAS (1\%). Additionally, rearrangement of ALK
    (3--7\%), RET (1\%) and ROS1 (1\%) and amplifications of FGFR1 (20\%) and
    MET (2--4\%) are found recursively. These mutations are rarely observed
    together in the same tumor.

    \textbf{Melanoma} develops from the malignant transformation of melanocytes
    in the basal epidermal layer of the skin. Exposure to UV light,
    immunosuppression, fair-skin and multiple nevi are risk factors. UV
    radiation causes cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs). T--T, C--C or C--T
    dimers (UV fingerprints) are formed, leading to direct DNA damage. People
    diagnosed with rare genetic disorders like xeroderma pigmentosum are at
    great risk. Traditionally, melanoma has been classified based on
    histological and pathological properties, such as the thickness of the
    tumor, ulceration or the anatomic location of the tumor.

    Spontaneous mutations in BRAF and NRAS and epigenetic modulations of APC are
    believed to promote progression of normal epithelium into a dysplastic
    nevus. Mutations affecting genes PTEN and CDKN2A and altered gene expression
    of MGMT or RASSF1 then favor invasion of the dermis, which is underlying to
    the epidermis, in the radial growth phase. Genetic and epigenetic
    alterations in AKT, MTAP, APAF, CDH1 and CDH2 then result in the vertical
    growth phase, where the tumor invades surrounding tissues. Finally, loss of
    TP53 functionality and further epigenetic modulations of MTA2 and MAGE
    enable metastasis.

    The occurrence of the different mutations differs by the anatomic location
    of the tumor, e.g. whether the specific body part is chronically exposed to
    the sun. Mutations frequently found in melanoma, which are potential targets
    for targeted therapy, occur on BRAF (37--50\%), NRAS (13--25\%), MEK
    (6--7\%), NF1 (11.9\%), CTNNB1 (2-4\%), GNAQ (1.3\%) and GNA11 (1.2\%).

    \textbf{Colorectal cancer (CRC)} 1.4 million cases are detected yearly with
    694,000 deaths. CRC is one of the best studied cancers. The development of
    colorectal adenocarcinomas occurs over many years. Caused by the acquisition
    and accumulation of driver mutations, a normal colorectal epithelium can
    progress to adenoma, which develops into carcinoma, which can eventually
    mestastasize.

    The molecular progression models in CRC are dependent on the underlying
    instability process (chromosomal vs. microsatellite). In CRCs, where CIN
    is the driving force, loss of the tumor suppressor gene APC is often
    causing the evolution from a normal to a hyperproliferative epithelium.
    Progression to adenoma stages are associated with DNA hypomethylation, KRAS
    activation and loss of 18q. Mutations in TGF$\beta$RII and PIK3CA and loss
    of TP53 by LOH at 17p then lead to the final carcinoma stage. In MSI
    CRCs, mutations and hypermethylations in MMR genes result in an
    hyperproliferative epithelium. BRAF mutations, followed by PIK3CA mutations,
    loss of TP53 and frameshift mutations affecting TGF$\beta$RII, BAX or IGF2R
    are associated with CRC progression towards the carcinoma stage.

    Mutations recursively detected in CRC occur on KRAS (36--40\%), SMAD4
    (10--35\%), PIK3CA (10--30\%), BRAF (8--15\%), PTEN (5--14\%), NRAS
    (1--6\%), and  AKT1 (1--6\%).

    The mentioned molecular progression profiles are likely to be an
    oversimplification. These models are based on frequently found alterations
    in the respective cancers. Due to tumor heterogeneity, these alterations do
    not always have to be observed in the tumor, and the chronological
    appearance of these alterations may vary from one tumor to another.

    \subsubsection{Driver and passenger mutations}

      Cancer progression is a process that recognizes basic Darwinian evolution
      principles {\cite{clonal_evolution}} {\cite{darwinian_models}}
      {\cite{war_zone}} {\cite{cancer_models}}. The population of cancer cells
      harbors heritable genetic variation. These mutations may be of germline
      origin or may occur through somatic processes. If the occurring mutations
      are non--deleterious, they can be passed on to the next generation of cells.
      The second process, which has to take place for Darwinian evolution to take
      place, is natural selection. Each cell exhibits a unique combination of
      genetic and environmental perturbations. Cells are in competition for a
      variety of resources in their microenvironment, which include space, oxygen
      and nutrients. Eventually, cells with the best fitness, e.g. with the
      highest proliferative potential and the lowest death rate, are then selected
      through natural selection principles. These cells will outlast less fit
      cells. Additionally, these cells will continue to accumulate new mutations.
      This results in sequential waves of clonal expansion
      {\cite{clonal_evolution}}, leading to different subclones within the same
      tumor.

      Genomic instability in cancerous cells becomes a critical mechanism if it
      affects oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes, which have the potential to
      be causative tumor 'driver' mutations. The identification of driver
      mutations has been a central aim of cancer research. Mutations in at least
      350 human genes are found recursively in cancer genomes and are believed
      to contribute to cancerogenesis {\cite{cancer_genome}}. These driver
      mutations are positively selected during cancer progression and confer a
      growth advantage to the cells harboring them. Many alterations found in
      cancer cells are passenger mutations, which occur subsequently or
      coincidentally to driver mutations. These mutations are defined to not
      contribute to the selective fitness of the cell, even though this
      conception has been challenged by stochastic tumor progression simulations
      {\cite{stochastic_cancer}}. Some studies have reported that cancer cells
      carry 40--80 somatic mutations, and only 5--15 of them are driver
      mutations {\cite{som_mut}}.

      Estimating the number of somatic driver and passenger mutations and the
      rate at which they occur is not well established {\cite{driver_passenger}.
      Two tumors, even though histologically indistinguishable, might present
      different subsets of mutations {\cite{driver_passenger}
      {\cite{intertumor}}. This observation has been defined as inter-tumor
      heterogeneity. Additionally, tumors present heterogeneity at the
      intra--tumor level {\cite{intratumor}. Subclones of the tumor might
      present different mutations.

      Chemotherapy creates a selective environment {\cite{selective_chemo}}.
      Initially, patients often respond to the therapy, but might then become
      resistant to the treatment. This is due to intra-tumor heterogeneity: a
      subclone of the tumor might have acquired a driver mutation that confers
      resistance to the treatment. Chemotherapy might kill a large part of the
      tumor cells, but actively selects for this resistant clone. Eventually,
      this clone will be the origin of relapses and another treatment option is
      lost.

      \paragraph{Tumor suppressor} genes protect a cell from entering the path
      to cancer. They comprise genes encoding for cell adhesion proteins,  DNA
      repair proteins, proteins acting in apoptosis pathways, or cell cycle
      proteins. The action of these proteins inhibits metastasis, excessive cell
      survival or proliferation. Tumor suppressors mostly follow the two-hit
      hypothesis, which was first proposed by Knudson for the retinoblastoma
      protein (pRb): to inactivate the tumor-protecting role of tumor
      suppressors, two genetic events, often LOH in  combination with silencing
      point mutations or silencing of both alleles by somatic events, are
      necessary to inactivate both alleles of the gene.
      Compared to dominant oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes are often
      considered to be recessive. Alternatively, tumor progression can be
      influenced by functional haploinsufficiency of tumor suppressors.
      According to this conception, a disease state can emerge if a cell /
      organism has only one functional copy of a given gene and if it cannot
      produce enough of a gene product to establish a wild-type condition. APC
      and TP53 are amongst the best known tumor suppressors.

      Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC) protein has binding sites for
      microtubules, cytoskeletal regulator proteins and Wnt signaling proteins
      ($\beta$--catenin, axin). Wnt signaling regulates cell migration,
      polarity, differentiation, adhesion and apoptosis. In the canonical Wnt
      signaling pathway, a destruction complex, including APC, leads to
      $\beta$--catenin phosphorylation, followed by ubiquitination, marking it
      for degradation in the proteasome. Once Wnt binds to the N-terminus of an
      activated surface receptor of the Frizzled family and a
      co-receptor of the LRP5/6 family, the destruction complex is inhibited.
      Consequently, $\beta$--catenin is no longer marked for degradation and can
      translocate to the nucleus, where it acts on gene
      expression of target genes. Loss or dysfunction of APC leads to
      $\beta$--catenin accumulation in the nucleus even in the absence of  an
      extracellular stimulus.

      TP53 is one of the master guardians of the genome. In normal situations,
      p53, the protein encoded by TP53, is targeted for ubiquitination and
      degradation in the proteasome. In case of cellular stress, p53 is no
      longer ubiquitinated. p53 can then stop the cell cycle at the G1/S and
      G2/M transitions, induce DNA repair, and induce apoptosis if the damage
      cannot be repaired. TP53 thereby maintains genomic stability. The
      importance of TP53 as tumor suppressor gene becomes evident in the
      autosomal dominant Li--Fraumeni syndrome. People suffering from this
      disorder inherit only one functional copy of TP53 and are likely to
      develop cancer in early ages. One mechanism by which p53 acts on
      cell-cycle arrest is by activating expression of p21. p21 binds to the
      G1/S transition complex and inhibits its activity, leading to cell-cycle
      arrest. Inactivation or mutation of TP53 is a crucial step in many
      cancers, leading to a loss of control over DNA stability.

      \paragraph{Oncogenes} comprise several GTPases, transcription factors,
      receptor tyrosine kinases and growth factors. Overexpressed or overactive
      versions of these proteins lead to increased mitogenic signals, causing
      increased cell growth or proliferation. Mutations in proto--oncogenes can
      cause a loss of regulation or overactive proteins. Gene duplications or
      other chromosomal alterations lead to increased protein synthesis. Other
      mechanisms of importance include post-transcriptional mechanisms as
      misregulation of protein expression or increase of mRNA / protein
      stability. Two important oncogenic pathways include the RAS--RAF--MAPK and
      PTEN--PI3K--AKT pathways. Epithelial Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) is a
      cell surface tyrosine kinase receptor. Ligand-binding on EGFR can induce
      both the RAS--RAF--MAPK and the PTEN--PI3K--AKT  pathways. EGFR is
      anchored in the cytoplasmic membrane and is composed of an
      intracytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain, a short hydrophobic transmembrane
      domain and an extracellular ligand-binding domain. Ligand binding causes a
      conformational change of the receptor, which leads to homo-- or
      heterodimerization, followed by an auto-- and cross--phosphorylation of
      key tyrosine residues on its cytoplasmic domain. This forms docking sites
      for cytoplasmic adaptor proteins that contain phosphotyrosine-binding and
      Src homology 2 domains.

      Signaling through the PI3K--AKT pathway leads to cell growth,
      proliferation and survival. The signaling cascade is initiated by
      integrins, cytokine receptors, T and B cell receptors, G--protein coupled
      receptors, and receptor tyrosine kinases, such as EGFR. Activation of the
      receptor results in production of PIP3 by activation of PI3K. PIP3 is
      anchored in the cell membrane and acts as docking site for proteins
      containing PH domains, such as PDK1. PIP3-bound PDK1 partially activates
      Akt by phosphorylation. Full activation of Akt is achieved by
      phosphorylation of PDK1 by mTORC2. Activated Akt then acts on a variety of
      proteins necessary for protein synthesis, glucose metabolism, cell
      survival / death and proliferation. The phosphatases PP2A and PHLPP can
      dephosphorylate and thereby inactivate Akt. Additionally, PTEN
      dephosphorylates PIP3 and indirectly also inactivates Akt. Dysregulation
      of the PI3K--AKT has been associated with several human diseases including
      neurological diseases, diabetes and cancer. In cancer, inactivation of
      PTEN and kinase activity activating mutations on PI3K and Akt are found
      recursively, leading to enhanced signaling, leading to inhibition of
      apoptosis and increased proliferation.

      In the RAS--RAF--MEK--ERK pathway, ligand binding on cell surface receptor
      tyrosine kinases activates the receptor. One of these receptors is the
      EGFR. GRB2 binds to Tyr1068 of EGFR through its SH2 domain
      and recruits SOS, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor. Grb2 and SOS then
      form a complex with the activated EGFR, which activates SOS. Activated SOS
      promotes recruition of Ras proteins to the activated EGFR. Through its GEF
      activity, SOS then induces GDP removal from Ras proteins, which can
      subsequently bind GTP and become active. Ras then recuits Raf proteins to
      the cell membrane and binds to their N-terminus. The activation of Raf,
      serine/threonine kinase proteins, is complex. In fact, Raf proteins are
      considered as gatekeepers of the RAS--RAF--MAPK pathway. In its inactive
      form, Raf is present in a 'closed' conformation, in which an
      autoinhibitory domain blocks the catalytic kinase domain. Recruitment to
      the cell membrane of Raf by Ras results in a conformational change, which
      disrupts the autoinhibitory interaction of Raf. Rafs then form homo-- or
      heterodimers, which leads to partial activation by allostery.
      Transphorylative events, with optional phosphorylation by other kinases,
      such as PAK1, then fully activates Raf. Activated Raf can now bind to
      MEKS, which are tyrosine/threonine kinases. MEKs then phosphorylate ERKSs,
      which are also serine/threonine kinase enzymes. ERKs then translocate to
      the cell nucleus, where they influence expression of target genes.
      RAS--RAF--MEK--ERK signaling promotes cell-cycle progression, cell
      differentiation, growth and survival.

  \subsection{Targeting the EGFR signaling pathway}

    \subsubsection{Biological Role of EGFR in Solid Tumors}

      In normal cells, the tighly regulated EGFR signaling pathway drives
      cell-cycle progression, affects differentiation and migration and  acts as
      a survival signal. EGFR ligand binding leads to an activation of several
      signaling cascades, such as the PI3K--AKT, RAS--RAF--MEK--ERK, JAK--STAT
      and NFkB pathways. The EGFR pathway is long known to be dysregulated in
      most solid tumors. EGFR levels have been demonstrated to be higher in CRC
      samples than in surrounding tissues. Also, more of EGFR's ligands EGF and
      TGF$\alpha$ are found in these locations. EGFR overexpression may result
      from epigenetic alterations or gene amplification. Increased EGFR mRNA
      levels in in vitro culture of human CRC cells  has also linked EGFR
      overexpression to tumor progression. EGFR overexpression has been
      associated with poor prognosis, as this leads to a more aggressive
      progression.

      \paragraph{EGFR signaling as a survival signal}

        Cells communicate with their environment. Without extracellular signals,
        a cell undergoes apoptosis. Signaling pathways induced by cell--matrix
        interactions, cell-cell interactions, and soluble survival factors act
        on a variety of genes and proteins.

        Loss of matrix attachment leads to cell growth arrest and even cell
        death in normal epithelial cells, a process called anoikis. The
        cell--matrix interaction provides important spatial informations to the
        cell and acts as a safeguard against inappropriate proliferation and
        migration.

        Activation of the EGFR signaling pathway protects normal
        epithelial cells against anoikis in the suspended state. EGFR blockade
        sensitizes normal epithelial cells to apoptosis, but effect is much
        more pronounced in the suspended state than in the attached state. The
        redundancy of cell survival signals makes normal epithelial cells
        relatively resistant to EGFR-blockade in their normal microenvironment.

        Tumor cells are often in transit or at sites with inadequate matrix
        composition. They are often provided with inadequate or missing
        cell--cell or cell--matrix interactions. They are thereby more dependent
        on survival signals propagated by soluble mediators, such as EGF or
        TGF$\alpha$.  Consequently, tumor cells are relatively sensitive against
        blockade of EGFR (or other cell surface receptors. Due to inappropriate
        interactions, these cells heavily depend on survival signals propagated
        by soluble mediators, such as EGF or TGF$\alpha$. This is
        counterbalanced by an upregulation of cell surface receptors that
        activate anti--apoptotic pathways. MAPK activation in the
        RAS--RAF--MAPK--ERK pathway is required for high expression of Bcl--XL,
        an anti-apoptotic protein of the Bcl--2 family. Bcl--2 proteins can be
        either pro-- or anti--apoptotic and regulate liberation of cytochrome c
        from the mitochondria, which is essential in the apoptotic caspase
        pathway. Additionally, EGFR signaling leads to post-transcriptional
        phosphorylation on the pro-apoptotic Bad protein, which is thereby
        functionally inactivated.

    \subsubsection{EGFR-targeted drugs}

      The observations that EGFR is recursively upregulated in many cancers
      and that EGFR is such an important mediator of not only cell-cycle
      progression and cell growth, but also cell survival, has lead to the
      development of agents that block this pathway. Pharmacologically,
      these agents can be classed by their mode of action: EGFR-targeted
      monoclonal antibodies and EGFR-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
      Several proteins acting downstream of EGFR are recursively
      found to be mutated. This lead to the development of other targeted
      drugs, such as BRAF-- or MEK--inhibitors. Table XXX shows a selection
      of FDA-approved cancer drugs that target components of the EGFR signaling
      pathway.

      Anti--EGFR monoclonal antibodies bind to the extracellular domain of EGFR
      in its inactive state and thereby compete for EGF or TGF$\alpha$ binding.
      They thereby inhibit ligand-induced EGFR tyrosine kinase activation. The
      most popular anti--EGFR monoclonal antibody is cetuximab. Cetuximab binds
      to EGFR with a higher affinity than the natural ligands EGF or
      TGF$\alpha$. Cetuximab binding induces internalization of EGFR, following
      by its degradation. Cetuximab also binds to EGFRvIII, a constantly active
      version of EGFR. Cetuximab blocks cell--cycle  progression at the G0/G1
      boundary, inhibits cell proliferation and induces cancer cell death.

      EGFR-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors comprise three classes that
      include first generation reversible  EGFR-inhibitors (gefitinib,
      erlotinib), second generation irreversible inhibitors (afatinib,
      dacomitinib, neratinib) and third generation mutant-selective inhibitors
      (brigatinib, osimertinib, rociletinib). Third generation agents have a
      better sensitivity against mutated than wild-type EGFR and have been
      designed to further decrease treatment-associated side effects. Tyrosine
      kinase inhibitors are low molecular weight molecules that are mainly
      derived from quinazoline. These compounds bind to EGFR and block
      ligand-induced receptor phosphorylation by occluding the ATP--binding
      site. This results in inhibition of cell proliferation, cell--cycle arrest
      at the G0/G1 boundary and apoptosis.

    \subsubsection{Predictive markers}

      Mutations in EGFR and downstream proteins are predictive of the potential
      success of EGFR-targeted therapy. In many cases the predictive value of a
      marker, even though theoretically reasonable, has not yet been
      established. Demonstration of the predictive value of these markers is not
      trivial and has to be proved in clinical trials. The search for
      additional predictive markers is ongoing and many EGFR-targeted
      agents are still in clinical trials.

      \paragraph{EGFR} is a strong predictive biomarker for the success of the
      administration of EGFR-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors. EGFR
      activating mutations are observed in 10--35\% of NSCLC. 90\% of EGFR
      mutations are exon 19 deletions (48\%) and exon 21 L585R (c.2573T$>$G)
      (43\%) point mutations. In melanoma and CRC, EGFR mutations are seldom.
      These mutations confer increased sensitivity to EGFR--specific tyrosine
      kinase inhibitors. Patients with EGFR--mutated tumors have a longer
      progression-- free survival than those treated with traditional
      chemotherapy. Also, patients with EGFR--mutated tumors display a better
      prognosis if treated with EGFR TKI compared to patients with WT EGFR
      cancers. An interesting demonstration of tumor placticity is the EGFR
      T790M variant, which occurs in 5\% of untreated NSCLCs. Its frequency
      drastically increases to 50\% in NSCLC tumors that have acquired
      resistance to TKIs. However, a study has shown that this resistance
      mutation may be lost after an arrest of TKI administration and that
      patients can be treated again with TKIs after a certain period. EGFR
      T790M increases sensitivity to third generation TKIs (mutant--specific).
      The mutation status of EGFR has no predictive value for monoclonal
      antibody administration. EGFR--specific antibodies have been associated
      with an increased benefit from cetuximab administration. 

      \paragraph{KRAS} mutations are found in 36--40\% of CRCs, 15--25\% of
      NSCLC, and in 2\% of melanomas. Critical mutations in the KRAS gene
      include mutations in codons 12, 13 and 61. Amongst these, the G12C variant
      is the most common. These mutations lock KRAS in its GTP-bound state,
      resulting in a constantly active protein. This then leads to a constantly
      active signal transduction. Blocking EGFR in that case is useless, as KRAS
      acts downstream of EGFR. Several KRAS point mutations in codons 12, 13 and
      61 have been shown to confer reduced sensitivity to EGFR-targeted
      monoclonal antibodies in CRC and EGFR--TKIs in NSCLC.

      \paragraph{NRAS} is an isoform of KRAS. Activating mutations in NRAS
      codons 12 and 61 are found in 1--6\% of CRCs, 13--25\% of melanomas and
      1\% of NSCLCs. NRAS mutations have been associated with reduced
      sensitivity to EGFR monoclonal antibodies in CRC. The predictive value of
      the influence of NRAS mutations in NSCLC and
      melanoma is unknown at this time.

      \paragraph{BRAF} mutations are very common in melanoma (37--50\%) are
      found in 8--15\% of CRCs and 1--4\% in NSCLCs. Amongst BRAF-mutated
      melanomas, the V600E variant is found in 80--90\% cases. The V600E variant
      occurs in the activation segment of the BRAF kinase domain and results in
      increased kinase activity. BRAF mutations usually confer a resistance to
      EGFR-targeted therapy in KRAS WT tumors. BRAF V600E mutations have been
      associated with increased sensitivity to BRAF inhibitors in melanoma and
      NSCLS and MEK inhibitors in melanoma.

  \subsection{Tumor DNA Sequencing}

    Cancer sequencing using next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods provides
    more information in less time compared to traditional single-gene and
    array-based approaches. With NGS, researchers can perform whole-genome
    studies, targeted gene profiling, tumor-normal comparisons, and more. NGS
    also offers the sensitivity to detect rare somatic variants, tumor
    subclones, and circulating DNA fragments.

    the field of cancer genomics has been impacted most profoundly by the
    application of next-generation sequencing technology, which has
    tremendously accelerated the pace of discovery while dramatically reducing
    the cost of data production.

    Many biological discoveries about cancer have been the product of a reductionist
    approach, which focuses on modeling phenomena with as few major actors and
    interactions as possible [1, 2]. This reductionist thinking led the initial
    theories on carcinogenesis to be centered on how many “hits” or genetic
    mutations were necessary for a tumor to develop. It was assumed that each type
    of cancer would progress through a similar, if not identical, process of genetic
    hits.

    However, most cancers are genetically complex, and are better defined by the
    activation of signaling pathways rather than a defined set of mutations. The
    success of the Human Genome Project inspired similar projects looking at the
    genome in various cancers [4]. That success, along with the increased
    affordability and reliability of sequencing [5], has led to the integration of
    genome science into clinical practice.
