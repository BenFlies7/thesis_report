\section{Introduction}

  Cancer represents a huge burden for health care systems worldwide and one of
  the leading death causes. In 2012, there were an estimated 14.1 million new
  cancer cases with estimated  8.2 million cancer deaths
  {\cite{cancer_stats_worldwide:2012}}. Lung cancer is the most common cancer,
  both in terms of new cases (1.8 million) and deaths (1.6 million). Breast
  cancer is the second most common cancer (1.7 million cases) but only ranks 5th
  as cause of death (522,000 deaths). Colorectal cancer (1.4 million cases;
  694,000 deaths), prostate cancer (1.1 million cases; 307,000 deaths), stomach
  cancer (951,000 cases; 723,000 deaths) and liver cancer (782,000 cases;
  723,000 deaths) are following.

  Scientific discoveries in the last decade have had an enormous impact on our
  understanding of the underlying causes of cancer. The development of omics
  techniques, in combination with enhanced computational power, has lead to an
  explosion of biological data. It has become clear that cancer is an incredibly
  complex malignancy. The research community is trying to interprete this vast
  amount of data with the goal to get a deeper understanding of cancer and to
  cure it eventually. In recent years, several drugs have been approved that
  target proteins needed for cancer development, proliferation or metastasis.
  Molecular testing is employed to check whether these targeted drugs would be
  of benefit. In that regard, Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) is an interesting
  method to gain deep insights into the genetic information of a tumor and to
  guide personalized therapy.

  \subsection{Targeting Cancer}

    Virtually all cancers tend to accumulate mutations during their progression.
    The genetic diversity caused by this instability, the cardinal feature of
    cancer, in combination with several environmental factors, such as
    inflammation, enables the hallmarks of cancer (Hallmarks of Cancer: The Next
    Generation). These include replicative immortality, cell death resistance,
    ongoing proliferative signaling, invasion and metastasis, growth suppressor
    evasion, inducement of angiogenesis, energy metabolism reprogramming and
    immune destruction evasion.

    Large-scale studies have demonstrated that cancers are highly heterogeneous.
    This heterogeneity has been observed both at the inter- and intra-level. Two
    tumors of similar phenotype often comprise a different subset of mutations
    that may even have a low overlap. Several clonal subpopulations within the
    same tumor contribute to the intra-tumor heterogeneity. This is a
    considerable problem in the clinics, as some subpopulations of a cancer may
    become resistant to the  treatment and may be the source of relapses.

    Many alterations found in cancer cells are passenger mutations, e.g. do not
    contribute to the selective fitness of the cell. Driver mutations, often
    happening on oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes, promote the cell's
    fitness. This concept recognizes Darwinian evolution principles. The
    heterogeneous  population of cancer cells harbors cells with different
    random somatic and non-deleterious mutations and exhibits different
    perturbations. Cells with the best fitness, e.g. with the highest
    proliferative potential  and the lowest death rate, are then selected
    through natural selection principles. These cells will outlast less fit
    cells. This results in  sequential waves of clonal expansion, leading to
    different subclones within the same tumor that differ in their
    proliferative, migrative and invasive potential. The hypothesis that
    passenger mutations, that occur subsequently or coincidentally to driver
    mutations, do not influence the cell's fitness at all has been
    challenged by stochastic tumor evolution simulations (citat). Since then,
    it has been proposed that, even though the individual effect may be
    small, the cooperation of multiple accumulated small-scale passenger
    mutations plays a present role in cancer development and progression.

    Genomic instability in cancerous cells becomes a critical mechanism if it
    affects oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. Tumor suppressor genes protect
    a cell from entering the path to cancer. They comprise
    genes encoding for cell adhesion proteins,  DNA repair proteins, proteins
    acting in apoptosis pathways, or or cell cycle proteins. The action of these
    proteins inhibits metastasis, excessive cell survival or proliferation. Tumor
    suppressors mostly follow the two-hit hypothesis, which was first proposed
    by Knudson  for the retinoblastoma protein (pRb): to inactivate the
    tumor-protecting role of tumor suppressors, two genetic events,
    often LOH in  combination with silencing point mutations, are necessary to
    inactivate both alleles of the gene. Another possibility of tumor
    suppressor inactivation is methylation of the gene promoter. Compared to
    dominant oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes are often considered to be
    recessive. Alternatively, tumor progression can be influenced by functional
    haploinsufficiency. According to this conception, a disease state can emerge
    if a cell / organism has only one functional  copy of a given gene and if it
    cannot  produce enough of a gene product to establish a wild-type condition.
    Oncogenes comprise several GTPases, transcription factors, receptor tyrosine
    kinases and growth factors. Overexpressed or overactive versions of these
    proteins often lead to increased mitogenic signals, causing increased
    cell growth or proliferation. Mutations in proto--oncogenes can cause a
    loss of regulation or overactive proteins. Gene duplications or other
    chromosomal alterations lead to increased protein synthesis. Other
    mechanisms of importance include post-transcriptional mechanisms as
    misregulation of protein expression or increase of mRNA / protein stability.

      \paragraph{Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma}

        Lung cancer is the most common cancer in developed countries. Smoking
        is a widely accepted risk factor, as chemical carcinogens in tobacco
        smoke induce several genetic mutations. Oncogenic triggers cause cells
        of the normal bronchial epithelium to proliferate, giving rise to
        meta--, hyper-- and dysplastic epithelial lesions. blablabla

        Deletions of 3p, 9p21, 13q14, and 17p13 are often observed in early
        stages of lung cancer. These chromosomic regions contain TP53,
        Retinoblastoma (RB), p16INK4A/p14ARF/p15INK4B proteins, which act as tumor
        suppressors. TP53 mutations occur in 40--70\% of NSCLC. RB mutations
        are detected in the majority of SCLC (>90\%), but only in 15--30\% of
        NSCLC.

        TGF-b strongly inhibits the proliferation of normal epithelial cells
        including bronchial and peripheral lung epithelial cells through the
        induction of CDK inhibitors. TGF-b signaling is known to be impaired by
        the activation of the MAPK cascade and NF-kB pathway. Lung cancer cell
        lines often show unresponsiveness to TGF-b signal, while expres- sion
        profiling analysis has demonstrated that expression of the TGFbRII is a
        characteristic feature of normal lung tissues when compared with lung
        cancer specimens. Although the intracellular mediators of TGF-b
        signaling, Smad4 and Smad2, are indeed mutated in lung cancer , the low
        frequencies of these alterations indicated that Smad4 and Smad2
        mutations do not account for the frequent TGF-b insensitivity, raising
        the possibility that addi- tional molecules are involved. Indeed, it was
        recently reported that the expression of TGFbRII is frequently lost in
        lung cancers due to an epigenetic mechanism involving histone
        deacethylation and altered chromatin conformation. Genetic alterations
        of TGFbRII such as frame-shift mutations, as have been shown to be
        relatively frequent in colorectal cancers with the microsatellite
        instability phenotype, are rarely observed in lung cancers, perhaps
        being consistent with a lack of marked microsatellite instability in
        lung cancers.

        Cell cycle checkpoints induce arrests/delays of cell cycle progression
        and provide sufficient time for DNA repair, if possible, thereby
        protecting cells against carrying over damaged DNA. Although the
        mechanism to sense DNA damage is not yet fully understood, double-strand
        DNA breaks activate a series of signal transducing reactions, in which
        the ATM and ATR kinases play central roles by phosphorylating several
        key molecules including CHK1, CHK2, p53, BRCA1 and NBS1, leading to
        further downstream signaling and cell cycle arrest/delay at G1, S, and
        G2. Frequent genetic alterations of the p53 gene impair the G1
        checkpoint in the majority of lung cancers.

        Alterations in the number of chromosomes are very frequently observed in
        lung cancer, while chromosomal instability has been shown to be a common
        feature of lung cancer cells. While the mitotic spindle checkpoint is
        involved in assuring a properly ordered chromosome segregation by
        prevent- ing cells with an unattached kinetochore from entering into
        mitosis, lung cancer cell lines exhibit frequent impairment of this
        checkpoint. Mutations of the BUB and MAD genes, essential components of
        the mitotic-spindle checkpoint, have been detected in lung cancers,
        albeit at low frequencies. Cahill et al. (1998) reported that defects in
        the mitotic checkpoint are closely associated with the presence of
        chromosome instability in colorectal cancers, but there appear to be
        additional alterations in lung cancers, since there are examples of
        chromo- some instability without mitotic checkpoint impairment.

        Many tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases are involved in
        growth-promoting pathways, while several phosphatases negatively
        regulate these pathways. PTEN/MMAC1 functions as a phosphoinositide
        3-phosphatase that negatively regulates Phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase
        (PI3K)/AKT signaling, and has been suggested to be involved in the
        induction of anoikis and inhibition of cell migration. The 11q23 region
        is one of the most frequent targets for chromosomal deletions in a
        variety of cancers including lung cancer, and has been suggested to
        harbor at least two putative tumor suppressor genes. TSLC1/IGSF4
        encoding an immunoglobulin superfamily member was recently cloned from a
        genomic fragment corresponding to 11q23.2, based on its functional
        competency in the suppression of the tumorigenicity of human A549 and
        mouse Lewis lung cancer cell lines. Although TSLC1 appears to carry
        mutations rather infrequently, expression of TSLC1 has been shown to be
        frequently reduced by DNA hypermethy- lation of its promoter region.

        Cell proliferation is positively regulated by several growth-promoting pathways including MAP kinase cascades as well as PI3K – AKT, Phospholipase C (PLC) – PKC, and NF-kB pathways. These pathways are functionally associated with each other. For example, a growth factor-mediated signal may diverge through a tyrosine kinase receptor into several pathways such as the RAS – RAF – MAPK, PI3K – AKT, and PLC – PKC pathways, whereas NF-kB is convergently activated by several distinct stimuli, including growth factors, cytokines, and extra-cellular matrix (ECM) attachment. Therefore, one alteration of a component of a growth-promoting pathway may aberrantly affect several signaling pathways, resulting in the broad range of regulatory changes of cell proliferation.

      \paragraph{Melanoma}


    The EGFR signaling pathway is an oncogenic pathway frequently altered in
    many cancers. EGFR signaling promotes metastasis, invasion, cell survival
    and proliferation by activating the RAS-RAF-MAPK and PI3K-Akt pathways. EGFR
    is part of the family of receptor tyrosine kinases. This transmembrane
    protein is composed of an intracytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain, a short
    hydrophobic transmembrane region and an extracellular ligand-binding domain.
    Ligand (EGF, TGFα) binding causes homo-- or heterodimerization, followed by
    an auto-- and cross--phosphorylation of key tyrosine residues on its
    cytoplasmic domain. This forms docking sites for cytoplasmic proteins that
    contain phosphotyrosine-binding and Src homology 2 domains.Activation of
    PTEN/PI3K/AKT leads to cell growth, proliferation and survival, while
    RAS-RAF-MAPK induces cell survival and cell cycle progression and
    proliferation. In the RAS-Raf-MAPK pathway, Grb2 and Sos, two adaptor
    proteins, form a complex with the activated EGFR. The resulting
    conformational change of Sos recruits Ras-GDP, which in turn becomes
    activated to form Ras-GTP. Ras-GTP activates Raf, which, in intermediate
    steps, phosphorylates a MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase). Activated
    MAPKs are then imported from the cytoplasm into the nucleus where they act
    on target genes. +++ PTEN/PI3K/AKT

    Many cancers have been shown to be dependent on EGFR signaling: they
    overexpress EGFR or to harbor activating mutations in EGFR or downstream
    proteins, both leading to increased mitogenic signals. Targeting the EGFR
    signaling pathway is an attractive target blabla and has been of benefit in
    solid tumors, e.g. melanoma, CRC and NSCLC. Advantages have been made better
    survival rates. shutting egfr down -> apoptosis. but 2 problems: resistances &
    not all mutations are actionable. therefore: molecular testing. the more
    comprehensible, the better. classical approaches only target some hotspot
    regions. NGS has the potential to give really deep insights

    predictive mutations
